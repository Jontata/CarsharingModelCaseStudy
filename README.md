# Carsharing Service Optimization Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources developed for my Bachelor Thesis: **"Quantitative Insights in Carsharing: Demand, User Preferences, and Profitability"**. The project investigates carsharing service optimization with a case study in Copenhagen.

## Project Components

In `notebooks`, code covering the logical steps:

    1) Synthetic Origin-Destination (O-D) Data Generation
    2) Travel Data Simulation

In `experiments`, the script to run the experiement design.

In `helpers`, helper function and scripts.

In `src`, the main python script to execute the experiments.
